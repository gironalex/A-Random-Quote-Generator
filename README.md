# A Random Quote Generator
 This project app takes an array filled with object quotes and selects one random quote to be displayed in the browser.
 
 The user will get able to get another random quote with a click of a button or a set interval that last 10 seconds will change
 the quote automatically. 
 
 Lastly, the background colors of the browser will change randomly by either pressing the button to get another quote or by the
 set interval method.
